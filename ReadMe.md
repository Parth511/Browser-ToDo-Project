#   Welcome to my ToDo Project

This is a project I made to revisit my concepts of HTML, CSS and JS. This project is about maintaining a list of tasks that need to be done

### To add a task

Simply click on the add icon(+) on the right hand side. Click on it after typing the task you want to list.

### To mark a task

Click on the green tick mark on the right hand side of the listed task. You can mark it as done and still keep it on the page to keep track of tasks completed. 

### To Delete a task

You can simply click on the trash bin icon on the extreme right of the task to delete it completely from local storage as well.

### Planning on adding the following features

1. Saving the marked tasks to local storage so that whenever the page is refreshed the marked tasks stay marked.
